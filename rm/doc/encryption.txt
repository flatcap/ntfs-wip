These are just a collection of notes on encryption in NTFS.

- System files cannot be encrypted.  Check the file attributes and if
  FILE_ATTR_SYSTEM is set refuse to encrypt.  This also means can sanity
  check that FILE_ATTR_SYSTEM and FILE_ATTR_ENCRYPTED are never set together.

- The desktop.ini file in each directory has a setting which can disallow
  encryption of files in it.  The section name is Encrpytion and the key name
  is Disable.

- Everything in %windir% except for Profiles directory is not encryptable as
  it is considered a system file.
