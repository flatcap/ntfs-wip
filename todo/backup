BACKUP
        save the essence of a file, dir or volume

        file:
                name
                timestamp
                security info
                data

        dir:
                name
                timestamp
                security info

        volume:
                label
                serial number
                security info
                cluster size?

        if partimage stores $Bitmap + data, it should be possible to write
        a thin layer to use the driver or tools on it
        md driver to piece archives together

        loopback mount file with decode plugin?

        backup as blocked files => can do incremental

        what about encrypted files?

        [compress|block] at file, dir? or fs level
