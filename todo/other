        new ntfs driver can overwrite existing files
        how about overwriting linux.img used by boot.ini?
        then you can update your lilo boot without having
        to copy files to ntfs

        if (ntfs_inode_close(ni)) {  // XXX lib doesn't check for null
        check entire lib

        decode a binary mft record into english

        find_external_attr
        144 test cases?
        1 attr, 2 attr
        search starts before, on 1st, on 2nd, after
        attr is in 1st record,
        attrs are split over 2 records,
        attr(s) are in 2nd record
        search by type, name, val (any combo)

        ntfs_inode_open succeeds on an mft extent!
