CHKDSK
        rip out of resize

        1) check bitmap
        2) check directory structure
        3) check security info (how?)

        1) check boot record
        2) check mft and mirr match
        3) check all mft file records
        4) check mft bitmap against file records
        5) look for circular directory references

        option to look for bad sectors (and optionally do something about them)

        two sets of flags?  to_check flags and to_fix_flags?

        can we validate any other metadata?
        attrdef, upcase?

        1 and 2 need separating out of libntfs and the mount sequence

        /f - what can we safely fix?
        fix boot record
        find which of mft and mirr is correct?  and overwrite the other
        replace bad mft records with BAAD?
        try and recover data from BAAD records?
        fix bitmap set/reset nec bits

        reorder the above, i.e. mft record check before bitmap

        Error Message:
        CHKDSK detected minor inconsistencies on the drive.
        Explanation:
        Chkdsk found file system inconsistencies on the volume which do not
        affect file system usage.
        User Action:
        No user action is needed. The inconsistencies can be safely ignored.

        Corrupt Attribute Definition Table. CHKDSK is assuming the default.
        likewise Upcase

        Do you want AUTOCHK to be run the next time that the system restarts?
        [Y] text

        invalid timestamps

        Two files (or directories) attempted to access the same disk space.

        check attributes sizes and (non-)resident-ness against attrdef

        lots of flags   
                to_check_flags
                to_fix_flags
