compare gross features
        ntfs version
        volume size
        cluster size
        volume label
        freespace
        look at $Boot for more ideas

compare metadata
        records in mft
        log file size
        log file clean / last used datetime
        mft mirr location

compare dirs
        refer to same dir
        which is newer
        file counts

compare files
        refer to same file
        which is newer
        which is bigger
        which has more named streams
        level of fragmentation

compare attributes
        which mft record has more
        which are newer
        which are bigger

Same file/dir implies same sequence number (mft record not reused)
compare attribute ids
compare timestamps
file could be newer, but accessed less recently

add command-line options for all these comparisons (and --all)
